# Examples

Worked examples, each one self-verifying: every file asserts its own invariants and exits
non-zero when one fails. `python scripts/exrun.py` runs them all and reports which toolchains are
absent rather than passing over them silently.

<!-- BEGIN generated: examples-index (python scripts/atlas.py index --write) -->
Derived from the tree and `atlas.yaml/example_runners`. Every row is executed by
`python scripts/exrun.py`, which CI runs before the contract.

## The rule these follow

**Standard library first.** Two of these examples once imported a package that was never
installed, so they could not run at all — an example nobody can execute is a skeleton, which is
exactly what this repository refuses in a language pack. If an example needs a dependency, it
needs a reason first.
