# The worktree layout this repository declares — as a DRY RUN by default.
#
# WHY: the previous version called `git worktree add` the moment it was executed. An example that
# mutates the repository when a reader runs it to see what it does cannot be exercised by any
# instrument, so it was never run and its argument handling was never checked. One system, two
# routes: the safe route prints and verifies, `--apply` is the only way to mutate anything.
#
# Verify: bash examples/git/worktree-layout.sh          (dry run, read-only, exits 0)
#         bash examples/git/worktree-layout.sh --apply my-topic
