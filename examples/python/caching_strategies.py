"""Five caching strategies under one crash and one direct database write — each trade-off PROVEN.

Decision record: systems/decisions.yaml `caching_strategies` (`atlas decide caching_strategies`).
The claims below are the record's; this file exits non-zero if any of them stops being true.

  write-through   every acknowledged write survives a cache crash; each write pays for the DB
  write-back      a crash between acknowledgement and flush LOSES acknowledged writes
  write-around    writes skip the cache, so a hot key re-read after a write misses once
  cache-aside     a write made straight to the DB is invisible until the entry is invalidated
  read-through    the application never touches the DB; the cache fills itself on a miss
