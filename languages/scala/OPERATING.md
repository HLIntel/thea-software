# Scala Operating Card

**Route:** JVM services, typed functional cores, data pipelines, Java interop.

**Fast path:** `scalafmt` → `sbt compile` → `sbt test` → property tests on the invariants that matter.

**Native authority:** scalac, sbt, the JVM, and the Scala 3 type system.

**Pair with:** Python for orchestration and analysis; SQL for persistence; Go or Rust where a JVM start-up cost or a GC pause cannot be paid.

**Boundary:** a sealed trait hierarchy or a schema — never an untyped `Map[String, Any]` crossing a service edge.

**Avoid:** `null`, unsafe `asInstanceOf`, implicit conversions as a design tool, `Await.result` on a request path, unbounded `Future` fan-out with the global execution context.

**Reliability:** explicit execution contexts, bounded parallelism, timeouts on every effect, and a back-pressured stream rather than a queue nobody bounded.

**Verify:** the fast path above, every step.

**AI learning loop:** read the types → follow one effect to its edge → change a signature on purpose → test → profile the JVM, never guess at it.
