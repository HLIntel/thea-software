# Anti-Blob Engineering

A blob is a module, artifact, generated file, or data object that grows beyond useful reasoning and control boundaries.

## Code blobs

Advisory review triggers:
- a source file approaching the file cap (`atlascore.MAX_CODE_LINES`, enforced)
- a function approaching the function cap `astshape.py` enforces and prints each run
- unrelated domains in one module
- high side-effect density
- giant mixed-responsibility routers
- generated code mixed with hand-maintained code

Split by ownership, domain, lifecycle, or failure boundary.

## Artifact blobs

Avoid committing build outputs, dependency caches, generated binaries, model weights, credentials, database dumps, temporary logs, or large archives that do not serve source history (`atlascore.MAX_BLOB_BYTES`, enforced).

Use release artifacts, package registries, object storage, Git LFS, or reproducible generation when an artifact genuinely belongs outside source control.

## Payload blobs

Every large external payload should have a schema, size limit, streaming/chunking policy, retention, cleanup path, and source of truth.

## AI rule

Never ask an agent to rewrite a large file before identifying its responsibilities and dependency graph. Large-context rewrites increase accidental semantic mutation.

## What enforces this now

- **`scripts/astshape.py`** refuses two functions with the same canonical AST — names, literals and
  docstrings erased — because a generator repeats a SHAPE far more often than a string. It caught
  two invariants written separately that compiled identically; they are now one helper.
- **The caps are a ratchet that only falls**, and they have: 278 → 262 → 259 → 239 → 232 → 221 →
  210 → 202, each step a function the gate refused and a split that earned it.
- **The install footprint is bounded too** — `context_policy/install_footprint`, in bytes, with a
  rise required to name what earned it. Moving this repository's own maintenance out of the wheel
  took a consumer's install from 212 KiB to 160 KiB. *(measured at v2.25.0)*
