"""Coverage-guided fuzz target for the JSONC reader.

WHY THIS ONE. `parse_jsonc` is a hand-written parser over untrusted-shaped text: editor
configuration, written by people and by tools, carrying comments and trailing commas that JSON
does not allow. It exists because the obvious implementation — strip `//` with a regular
expression — deletes the rest of any line containing the delimiter, INCLUDING the one inside
"https://example". That is not a hypothetical: it is how a task file in this repository first
failed to load.

A parser written to avoid one string-state bug is exactly the code most likely to contain
another, so it is fuzzed rather than trusted.

THE PROPERTIES, and the second is the one that matters:

  1. IT NEVER RAISES ANYTHING BUT ValueError. A caller catches that; anything else takes down the
     contract, and a guard that crashes on malformed input reports none of the malformation.
  2. ON COMMENT-FREE INPUT IT AGREES WITH json EXACTLY. Where the dialects overlap, a second
     parser that disagrees with the standard one is worse than no second parser.
  3. A STRING CONTAINING A COMMENT DELIMITER SURVIVES INTACT. The bug this file exists for.
  4. A TRAILING COMMA OUTSIDE A STRING IS DROPPED, AND ONE INSIDE IS DATA. The trailing-comma
     scan once rewrote `"[1, 2,]"` inside a literal; a parser that kept every comma passed 1-3.

Runs two ways, like the grammar target: under atheris for the coverage-guided campaign, and on a
deterministic corpus with `python fuzz/fuzz_jsonc.py`, so it is exercised where atheris is absent.
A fuzz target nobody can run is a skeleton.
