"""Coverage-guided fuzz target for the manifest entry grammar and the router.

WHAT IT IS FOR. The entry grammar decides how every declared tool in every language pack is
classified, and the router decides which pack answers for a file. Both take arbitrary text from a
document a human wrote, and both are consulted by instruments whose output is trusted. A seeded
property sweep already covers them in `scripts/atlas_test.py`; this is the coverage-guided version,
which explores inputs a generator picks rather than inputs a person imagined.

IT RUNS TWO WAYS ON PURPOSE:
  * under atheris (ClusterFuzzLite, CI fuzzing) — `TestOneInput` is the libFuzzer entry point;
  * on its own, with a deterministic corpus — `python fuzz/fuzz_manifest_entry.py`, so the target
    is EXERCISED even where atheris is not installed. A fuzz target nobody can run is a skeleton,
    and this repository refuses those; the corpus run is what keeps it honest between campaigns.

THE INVARIANTS IT ASSERTS, each one a way the classifier could be wrong:
  1. `entry_kind` always returns one of the declared kinds, or `invalid`. Never an exception.
  2. A `command` entry yields at least one PATH name; every other kind yields none. These two
     functions disagreed on "" and "|" before the property sweep found it.
  3. No produced binary name contains a space — a name with a space cannot be resolved.
  4. Anything the grammar ACCEPTS must be classifiable: the pattern and the classifier cannot
     disagree about what a legal entry is.
  5. `route_for` never raises and never invents a route that is not a declared target.
