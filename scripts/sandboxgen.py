"""Generate the host sandbox a task contract needs, from config/agent-sandbox.json.

WHY (3.12.0). The runner refuses what it is asked about, and four sandbox rows are the HOST's job: home
directory, network, identity, resources. They were declared and printed UNOBSERVED, and whoever ran the
agent had to translate prose into flags. This writes the flags: the declaration becomes a command, so the
host that runs it provides exactly the rows the contract names, and nothing is left to a reading of prose.

  docker <contract> [--image IMG]   a `docker run` argv: no network, read-only root, only the worktree
                                    writable, non-root, all capabilities dropped, bounded cpu/memory/pids,
                                    the contract's wall clock as a hard timeout, and no credential variable
  macos  <contract>                 a sandbox-exec profile: deny by default, no network, no read of the
                                    home directory's secrets, writes only to the worktree and a temp dir

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE: that the host ran it. A generated command is a declaration until it runs; the
macOS profile is proven on this machine by atlas_guards_test (a home write and a connect must fail).
A network 'allowlist' is REFUSED: it needs an egress proxy, and a flag cannot provide one.
