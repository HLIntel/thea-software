"""What a consuming repository's pull request requires, resolved against a pinned atlas.

WHY IT REPORTS AND DOES NOT VERIFY (2.11.0). This runs inside someone else's repository, where it
knows the diff and knows nothing about the toolchain. A step that ran the caller's gates would be
guessing at commands it cannot see, and a workflow that prints green over gates it did not run is
the exact shape this atlas exists to refuse. So it answers one question — what does THIS change
require? — and names, for every gate it resolved, whether a tool can run it at all.

IT FAILS ON AN UNROUTABLE FILE rather than passing over it. A file the atlas cannot place is a
file whose gates nobody chose, and the useful moment to say so is before the change lands.
