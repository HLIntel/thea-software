"""Dead harness code: a top-level function or class that nothing in the tree names but its own definition.

WHY (3.14.0). The contract refused dead files, dead links and unowned instruments, and was blind to a dead
SYMBOL: a function every caller of which was deleted still reads as a capability to the next agent that
greps for it — the refuted-implementation trap, one level down. A name that appears once in the whole
tracked tree (its `def`) has no caller, no test, no doc and no dispatch. It is deleted, or its reason for
living is declared in atlas.yaml/orphan_exemptions — never silently kept.

WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE: a name built at run time (getattr on an f-string) is invisible to a text search, so
such a name is an exemption WITH its reason, which is the point: the indirection is written down.
