"""Does the atlas actually help a model? Three arms, one model, automatic scoring.

WHY THIS AND NOT `bench.py`. bench.py measures the ROUTER — it is deterministic and it proves the
routes are right. It cannot say whether a language model given this repository answers better than
the same model without it, because no model is involved. This runs one.

THE THREE ARMS, AND WHY THE THIRD IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS:

  unassisted   the question plus the names of the packs. Cheap, and it has to guess.
  routed       the question plus what `atlas route` returns for that file. Cheap AND specific.
  whole_tree   the question plus EVERY pack's declared tools. Accurate by brute force, and it is
               what an agent without a router actually has to read.

`routed` versus `unassisted` measures whether the atlas helps at all. `routed` versus `whole_tree`
is the token claim, and it is the only honest form of it: the atlas does not make a prompt smaller
than asking blind, it makes an ACCURATE answer cheap. Comparing a cheap wrong answer against an
expensive right one and calling the first efficient is the thing this file exists not to do.

SCORING IS MECHANICAL. Ground truth comes from the repository's own declarations — the route a
file resolves to, and the command that pack declares for a role. A substring match against a
declared string, with no judge and no rubric, so the number cannot drift with whoever reads it.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. One model, one phrasing, a handful of questions. It is evidence about
THIS model on THESE questions, it prints K and its own sample size, and a result from a single
phrasing is a sample and not an edge — the prompt is part of the experiment.
