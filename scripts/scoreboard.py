"""What the benchmarks measure, as a floor that only rises: one row per metric, simple enough to act on.

WHY (3.14.0). The measured benefits were a report: a table on the landing page and nothing that failed
when a number fell. A reviewer put it plainly — the figures are real, and nothing holds them. Each row
here is (metric, now, floor, headroom). Below its floor the build fails, because the benefit regressed.
Above its floor by more than `slack`, it fails too, and says what to raise the floor to — the same
only-rises ratchet the byte budgets use, so a gain is locked in the run that earned it.

  python scripts/scoreboard.py [--json]      the table; exit 1 on any row out of bounds

A number is the WORST model in the record (min over models), never the mean: a floor a mean clears
while one model regressed is a floor that one model walks under.
