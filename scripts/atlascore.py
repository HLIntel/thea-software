"""Atlas primitives: the declared rosters, the file readers and the router.

WHY THIS IS SEPARATE (1.3.0). scripts/atlas.py crossed its own MAX_CODE_LINES cap while gaining
machine-readable output, and the answer to a file hitting its cap is to split it by concern, not
to raise the cap on the guard that caught it. The arrows point one way: this module reads
atlas.yaml and the tree and knows nothing about the contract; atlasgen.py generates documents
from it; atlas.py enforces the contract and owns the CLI.
