"""ghaudit — does the LIVE GitHub configuration match config/github-controls.json?

WHY THIS EXISTS (1.3.0). The platform state used to be typed into SECURITY.md and
docs/GITHUB-FINALIZATION.md with a measurement date beside it. That is honest on the day it is
written and unfalsifiable afterwards: three lines of a previous audit had gone stale and read as
current, and the only way to notice was to re-run the commands by hand and compare by eye. State
in prose cannot be compared by a machine, so it rots quietly. This file makes the comparison
mechanical, and the documents now name the instrument instead of repeating its answer.

THREE LAYERS, KEPT SEPARATE, because a control can exist in the first two and stop nothing:
  declared   — config/github-controls.json, in Git, reviewed like code
  configured — what the GitHub API reports right now
  enforced   — a merge is actually refused without it, which required_status_checks decides

IT REFUSES RATHER THAN REPORTS when it cannot reach the API (exit 2). A green line printed by an
audit that never called anything is the exact failure this repository exists to prevent.

  python scripts/ghaudit.py                  # compare, print every row, exit 1 on any difference
  python scripts/ghaudit.py --json           # the same comparison as a record
  python scripts/ghaudit.py --print-ruleset  # the exact PUT body, generated from the declaration

BYPASS IS PRINTED, NOT ASSUMED AWAY: a rule with a bypass actor is enforced for everyone except
that actor, and the reader has to be told who that is.
