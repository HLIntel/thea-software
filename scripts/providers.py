"""Where a measurement may send a prompt: OpenAI-compatible endpoints, their key NAMES, their pace.

WHY (2.28.0). The A/B had been measured on three models behind one local router — a fact about three
models. Breadth across model families is what turns it into a claim, and every provider below speaks
the same chat-completions shape, so one harness reaches all of them.

KEYS ARE READ FROM THE PROCESS ENVIRONMENT ONLY, by NAME, and never printed, logged or written. This
repository is public: no key value, no local key-file path, no account id appears in it. The caller
loads its own keys (`set -a; . <your key file>`) before running. A missing key is REFUSED by name.

THE PACE IS DECLARED, NOT DISCOVERED. `rpm` is a conservative per-process request rate. A 429 that
gets through means the declared pace is too high — lower it here; never answer it with more retries.
A 402 means the window's budget is gone, and resilience latches the breaker for the run.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. That siblings on the same credential back off: a vendor sees the SUM of every
process on a key. Prefer a key no other job holds; the NVIDIA entry skips the first key for that reason.
