"""doctor — can THIS machine run each instrument, and what does it cost when one cannot?

WHY THIS EXISTS (v1.3.1). Every other instrument here answers a question about the repository.
None answered the question asked first by anyone — human, agent or CI runner — arriving in a fresh
checkout: *what can I actually run?* Without it the failure mode is the worst kind: a missing
optional dependency makes an instrument do nothing, and doing nothing looks exactly like finding
nothing. `ghaudit` with no `gh` on PATH refuses loudly by design; the point of this file is that
you learn it in one call, before you plan around the answer.

REQUIRED versus OPTIONAL is a real distinction and it is printed, not implied:
  REQUIRED  the contract cannot run without it — the exit code is non-zero.
  OPTIONAL  something narrower cannot run. The exit code stays 0 and the LINE NAMES what is lost,
            because a warning that does not say what it costs gets read as noise.

  python scripts/doctor.py           # a table, and an exit code
  python scripts/doctor.py --json    # the same as a record

BLIND SPOT, AND ITS OWNER: this proves a tool RESOLVES and answers a version flag. It does not
prove the version is new enough for a given pack, and it says nothing about the 29 language
toolchains — that is `packprobe.py --mode smoke`, which runs them pack by pack.
