"""Does using the atlas actually help? Measured where it can be, and REFUSED where it cannot.

WHY (2.15.0). This repository could prove it was internally consistent and could not prove it
improved anything. A contract that verifies its own documents and never measures an outcome is a
very rigorous way of being unfalsifiable.

WHAT THIS MEASURES, AND WHAT IT WILL NOT PRETEND TO. Four arms are declared — no atlas,
instructions only, route/plan, route/plan plus enforcement — and only two of them can be obtained
by an instrument here. The first is a DECLARED MODEL: the assumption is printed so it can be
attacked, and it is not a measurement. The second needs a real agent making real decisions, so it
is reported `not_run` with the reason, because a blank and a zero read the same in a table and
only one of them is honest.

THE RULES THIS OBEYS, ALL OF WHICH EXIST BECAUSE THEY WERE BROKEN SOMEWHERE ELSE FIRST:
  - K and the chance baseline are printed on every run. A bar cleared over K comparisons yields
    0.05K winners by luck, and a number with no baseline beside it is rhetoric.
  - The held-out set is reported SEPARATELY. A suite you select on is in-sample, and the router
    and the gate table were both written while looking at the fixed set.
  - It measures ROUTING and CONTEXT, not agent success. Those are what this repository actually
    controls; task success belongs to whoever runs the agent, and claiming it here would be
    measuring somebody else's work with my instrument.
