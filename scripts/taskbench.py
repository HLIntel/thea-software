"""Does Thea make a model better at work OTHER than routing? Blind against with-Thea, per task kind.

WHY (2.29.0). `abtest.py` asks which command or pack answers a file — one narrow skill. The owner
asked whether Thea improves reasoning, process, rule-following and more. Only a task whose correct
answer THIS REPOSITORY DECLARES can be scored without a judge, so each kind below reads its ground
truth from the tree:

  diagnose  REASONING. Given what a failure looks like from outside (`agent_failure_modes/looks_like`),
            name the failure mode. Blind gets the mode ids; with Thea gets each id beside its
            mechanism (`shape`). The model still has to go from symptom to cause.
  plan      PROCESS. Given a described change, list every gate that must pass before merge. Blind
            gets every gate name; with Thea gets `verification_policy/profiles`. The description
            never names the change class, so the model must classify before it can look anything up.
  hygiene   RULE-FOLLOWING. Would this repository's build refuse a sentence? Blind is told only that
            rules exist; with Thea gets the two rules that decide it. Labels come from the SAME
            patterns the build runs, and the run refuses if a fixture's label disagrees with them.

NOT MEASURED, AND SAID SO: visual design, open-ended strategy and arithmetic. Nothing in this tree
declares a right answer for them, and a judge model would score its own taste. A kind is added here
only when its ground truth is a declaration.

THE FIXTURES FOR `plan` AND `hygiene` ARE AUTHORED — written to exercise each class and each rule,
counted in K like every other choice. Results are a SAMPLE per model and phrasing, never an edge.
