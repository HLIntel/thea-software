"""Retry what can succeed, refuse what cannot, and never hammer what is down.

WHY (2.27.0). This repository's documents already said it — patterns/NO-UNBOUNDED.md,
systems/OPERATIONS-UPTIME.md, docs/ENGINEERING-CONCEPTS.md XIV — and its own network code did
none of it. abtest.py abandoned a whole model on ONE timeout, which is how the `deep` arm went
unmeasured. A doctrine the harness does not practise is a declared control with no enforcer.

THE CLASSIFICATION IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, and it has three answers, not two:

  transient   the next attempt can succeed — 408, 425, 429, 5xx except 501, timeouts, resets
  terminal    no retry can change it — 4xx, 501, a malformed answer
  exhausted   402: the WINDOW's budget is gone. Retrying is not slow, it is wasted, and the
              breaker LATCHES rather than cooling down. A 402 is not a 429.

Branches on the declared status code, never on an error message — a message is a rendering.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. That siblings back off. The breaker is per process, and a vendor sees
the SUM of every process on one credential; publishing a throttle where siblings read it is the
caller's job. It also does not make a non-idempotent call safe to retry — only retry calls whose
repetition is harmless, which is why this takes a function and never wraps a mutation silently.

    WHY (3.30.0). A 2xx, and a CLI exit 0, are RENDERINGS of success; the payload is the identity
    (code-quality §3). Measured next door three times: a provider answered HTTP 200 with
    `choices: null` and zero tokens to a key whose balance was gone, while the same account's
    OpenAI-compatible path answered 402 for the same condition; a generation endpoint answered 200
    with an empty data array; a 200 from a single-page app path was the app's HTML.

    THIS FUNCTION EXISTS BECAUSE THE RULE WAS WRITTEN TWICE HERE and the second copy was missing a
    clause. `providers.complete` refused a 200 with no `choices`; `providers._cli_once` checked only
    an error flag and then returned `str(out.get("result") or "")`, so an exit-0 run that produced
    NOTHING became an empty answer with a token count beside it — scored as a WRONG answer, when
    this repository's own rule is that a non-answer is never scored as wrong. Two constants that
    agree only because someone typed the same digit disagree the first time one is edited, and so
    do two copies of a predicate (surface-and-structure §3).

    A path segment that is all digits indexes a list. Absent, None, and an empty string, list or
