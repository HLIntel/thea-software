"""Which parts of this tree have not been re-examined lately — measured in CONTRACT VERSIONS.

WHY (2.26.0). A directory listing shows a last-touched date per path, and reading it is how this
gap was noticed: several directories had not been opened since a contract many versions back,
while the rules they encode had moved underneath them. Nothing measured that, so "which sections
am I forgetting" was answered by scrolling — which finds the ones you happen to look at.

MEASURED IN VERSIONS, NOT DAYS, and that is the whole design. A date says when somebody typed; a
contract version says which tree the path was last true of, and only the second can be compared
against what the contract now says. A path untouched for a week during a quiet week is fine; a
path untouched across eleven minor versions has been left behind by eleven changes to the rules.

WHY IT IS NOT PART OF `check`. It reads git history, which is a fact about THIS repository's
maintenance rather than about the contract a consumer runs — the same reason `ghaudit` and
`packprobe` stand alone. It also measures COMMITTED state, so editing a file does not clear its
flag until the edit lands, and a contract gate that a correct edit cannot satisfy is a gate that
gets worked around. It runs in CI and in the ladder as its own step.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. That a stale path is WRONG. Some paths genuinely should not change —
a licence, an example whose language did not move. So the horizon is a prompt to look, the
declaration carries an `exempt` list with a reason per entry, and a path that is simply correct
stays correct. What it refuses is the silent case: a path nobody has opened and nobody noticed.
