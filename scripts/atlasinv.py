"""The hard invariants: one function per promise, and the roster that refuses an unowned one.

WHY THIS IS SEPARATE (2.9.0). scripts/atlas.py crossed MAX_CODE_LINES — its own guard, on its own
file — the moment the agent controls were wired in. The answer to a file hitting its cap is to
split it by concern, not to raise the cap on the guard that caught it; atlascore.py exists for the
same reason and says so.

The concern is clean: atlas.yaml DECLARES the invariants, this module DECIDES each one, and
atlas.py runs the contract and owns the CLI. The arrows point one way — nothing here imports
atlas.py.

The split also repaired the instrument roster, which claimed `atlas.py invariants` was
scripts/atlasgen.py: true only in the sense that both were files nobody had re-read. The generator
now carries its own entry and this module carries the one named after what it does.

    bound that is too tight, which fails loudly on the next change. RAISING one is the opposite:
    it lets through exactly what the gate existed to refuse, and it always needs a person naming
    what earned it. So this never raises, and `--fix` cannot silence a gate.

    It exists because tightening was the single most repeated manual edit in the session that
    built these ratchets: measure, subtract, retype the number, re-run. That is toil, and toil
    next to a gate is what gets the gate removed.
