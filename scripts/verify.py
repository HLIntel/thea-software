"""What ACTUALLY passed: run the declared done set, one verdict per gate, read off the exit code.

WHY (3.9.0). "Done" was seven commands typed into a document; an agent ran some, read their output and
reported green. Three ways that lies, each now a row state instead of a sentence:
  FAIL      the gate exited non-zero                      -> run exits 1
  NOT RUN   the gate was not run (THEA_READ_ONLY on a      -> run exits 2: incomplete is not done
            mutating gate, or its program is missing)
  PASS      exit 0 — and the gate's own SCOPE/COVERAGE line is printed beside it, because a pass
            over 17 of 36 packs and a pass over 36 print the same exit code
The verdict is the exit code, never the text; the coverage line is shown, never parsed into a verdict.
