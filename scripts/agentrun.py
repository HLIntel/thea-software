"""The reference runner: the one caller in this tree that executes anything under the policy.

WHY IT EXISTS (2.9.0). `plan --json` produced a good-looking record and nothing compared it to
what happened afterwards, so an agent could plan one change and make another with no artifact
that disagreed. This runner closes the loop in one record: the SAME contract carries the plan and
the outcome, every planned gate appears in the result INCLUDING the ones that did not run, and the
changed files are compared against the paths the plan declared.

THE THREE THINGS IT REFUSES TO CLAIM.
  1. A gate that did not run is written `ran: false` with the reason. A missing gate and a passing
     gate are otherwise the same absence, which is the shape this record exists to refuse.
  2. The sandbox rows marked host-observed are printed UNOBSERVED. A task that ran outside a
     sandbox must never read as one that ran inside it.
  3. The environment is fingerprinted, because two runs reporting the same gate as passed under
     different toolchains are two different claims wearing one word.

IT IS NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY. It refuses what it is asked about. An agent that does not ask is
bounded by the host, per `atlas.yaml/agent_policy/sandbox_requirements`.
