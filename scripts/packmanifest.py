"""The language tool manifest contract — ONE reader for tools/tools.schema.json.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE (1.3.0). Three things need to understand a manifest: the contract
harness (does it conform?), packprobe (what can PATH answer for?), and PACK-TOOLS-SPEC.md (what
must an author write?). Before this file they would have needed three copies of the same
required-field rosters and the same entry grammar, and two copies of a roster agree only until one
of them is edited. The schema declares it once; this module is the only code that reads the
schema, and everything else reads this module.

WHY THE VALIDATOR IS WRITTEN OUT HERE rather than delegated to `jsonschema`: the harness has one
runtime dependency (PyYAML) and is expected to run in a bare checkout. The risk in a hand-written
validator is not that it is wrong — it is that it SILENTLY IGNORES a keyword and prints a clean
pass over a constraint nobody checked. So `_check` REFUSES on any keyword it does not implement
(`schema keyword not implemented`), which turns that failure mode from invisible into loud. The
implementation is cross-checked against `jsonschema` 4.26.0 by
`python scripts/atlas_test.py`, which skips that one case, by name, when the library is absent.
