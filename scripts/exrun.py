"""exrun — run every example this machine can, and say why it skipped the rest.

WHY THIS EXISTS (v2.2.0). The examples were documentation that happened to be code: one imported a
package that was never installed, so it could not run at all, and nothing noticed. An example
nobody executes is a skeleton — the exact thing this repository refuses in language packs, sitting
in the directory a reader copies from.

It holds NO roster of its own. Every file under examples/ is routed with this repository's own
router, and the recipe is looked up by route in atlas.yaml/example_runners. A file that does not
route, or whose route declares no runner, is REPORTED as unexercised rather than quietly passed
over: those two look identical in a summary and mean opposite things.

  python scripts/exrun.py            # PASS / FAIL / SKIP with the reason, exit 1 on any FAIL
  python scripts/exrun.py --json     # the same as a record

SCOPE: an example that PASSES proves its own assertions held on this machine with this toolchain.
It does not prove the pack's other declarations, which is `packprobe.py --mode smoke`, and it says
nothing about a toolchain that is absent — ABSENT IS NOT WRONG.
