"""The audit stream: a hash chain, not a log.

WHY A CHAIN (2.9.0). The structured outcome record this repository already described could be
written by the agent it describes. A log its own subject can append to can also be edited, and an
edited log is indistinguishable from an honest one — so the record proved nothing it was being
read to prove. Each event here carries the hash of the one before it, so removing or editing an
event breaks every hash after it and `verify` names the first break by sequence number.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, stated because the chain is exactly the kind of instrument that gets read
as proving more: a chain covers the events it CONTAINS. It says nothing about an action that was
never appended. That gap is closed by the runner being the only caller that executes anything,
and by the host — an agent that can run commands outside the runner is outside this instrument.

REDACTION HAS A FLOOR. Arguments and output are recorded as a hash and a byte count, never echoed,
so a secret in an argument does not enter the stream. The event kind, the exit code, the paths and
the sequence ARE recorded in full: a log redacted past the point of establishing what happened is
not an audit, it is a receipt for having logged.
