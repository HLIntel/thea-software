"""Thea as an MCP server: the same commands `thea` answers, offered as tools over stdio.

WHY A ROUTE, NOT A SECOND SYSTEM (3.7.0). Every tool here is a `thea` command, listed from the one
parser in commands.py and run as `atlas.py <command>` in a subprocess. So an MCP client, a shell and
a future front end get the same answer to the same question, and nothing here can drift from the CLI
because nothing here re-implements it. Its schema is derived from the parser's arguments.

THE MCP ROUTE IS READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. Flags that write (`--write`, `--run`, `--fix`) never
appear in a tool's schema and are refused if sent; instruments (which include landing and pushing)
are not offered at all. A client cannot set them wrongly because it cannot set them.

Transport: newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout (MCP stdio). Each call runs in its own
process with a timeout, so a command's prints never reach the protocol stream and a changed
atlas.yaml is read fresh on every call. SCAFFOLD: tools only — no resources or prompts yet.

  python scripts/thea_mcp.py                 serve on stdio
  claude mcp add thea -- thea-mcp            register an installed copy with Claude Code
