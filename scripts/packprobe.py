"""packprobe — how many of each language pack's DECLARED commands resolve on this machine.

WHY THIS EXISTS (v1.2.0). `atlas.py check` proves STRUCTURE: cards 29/29, manifests 29/29,
labels 29/29. Nothing proved that a declared tool EXISTS. A pack naming `cargo-mutants` in its
authority block is a rendering of intent; whether the binary resolves is the identity, and the two
had never been compared.

IT IS A REPORTER, NOT A GATE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Most of these toolchains SHOULD be absent
here: nobody needs `uiua`, `hare` and `carbon` installed on one Mac. A guard that fails on that
fires on correct code and gets silenced, so this prints COVERAGE beside the count instead of a
verdict.

WHAT CHANGED AT 1.3.0 — THE DENOMINATOR IS NOW DECLARED, NOT GUESSED. The previous version
inferred which entries were even probeable by looking at punctuation: anything with a space, a
parenthesis or a slash was assumed to be prose and dropped. That rule excluded 127 of 260 entries
(49%) — including `go test`, `zig fmt` and `cargo clippy`, which PATH can answer for perfectly
well — and a selection rule correlated with the quantity being measured manufactures the result
rather than adding noise to it. Every entry now declares its own kind under the grammar in
tools/tools.schema.json, this file reads that grammar through scripts/packmanifest.py, and the
four non-PATH kinds are counted and printed instead of silently leaving the denominator.

WHAT EACH MODE ANSWERS, AND WHAT IT LEAVES TO THE NEXT ONE:
  --mode resolve  `command -v` finds the FIRST WORD of a command entry on THIS machine's PATH.
                  It says nothing about a subcommand: `cargo mutants` resolves on cargo alone.
  --mode version  RUNS each resolved entry with a version flag, so a subcommand answers for
  --mode smoke    itself, and prints what it said. This is the resolve-mode limit, closed.

SCOPE, NOT A GAP — stated so a low number is not read as a defect:
  - A tool absent here may be present on another machine. ABSENT IS NOT WRONG, and no developer
    is expected to hold 29 toolchains: coverage is printed beside the count, never as a verdict.
  - Alternation (`lldb|gdb`) counts as resolved when EITHER side resolves, because the pack
    declared a choice, not a requirement; both are tried before it is called missing.
  - `lib:`, `builtin:` and `concept:` entries are real declarations that PATH cannot answer for.
    They are counted and printed by kind, never folded into coverage.
  - Whether a pack was exercised END TO END is a codespace's answer (.devcontainer/README.md)
    plus that pack's provenance; this file does not claim it.
