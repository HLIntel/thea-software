"""The install, the CLI and the MCP route, split out of atlas_test.py to keep it under the shape cap.

Named *_test.py because it IS a test harness. Like atlas_guards_test, run() takes the RUNNING
atlas_test module and registers into its counted CASES: a fresh `import atlas_test` would be a
second copy whose cases nobody counts.

  install_cases       only what the wheel ships, run from outside the atlas: check, doctor, roster, an instrument
  cli_and_mcp_cases   every command has a help line; the roster satisfies thea-commands/1; thea-mcp speaks
                      MCP, lists the CLI's own commands and refuses writes — each property planted and refused
