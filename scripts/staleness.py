"""What was edited longest ago, and which worktrees are hung — computed from git, never typed.

WHY (3.6.0). Drift starts where nobody has looked: a file untouched for many releases still states what
was true when it was written, and a worktree nobody finished still holds work that looks done from its
own terminal. Both are invisible until something reads their age.

  oldest [N]    the N least recently edited tracked files, oldest first, then each top-level area by the
                age of its most recent edit — the parts of the tree that have gone longest unread
  review        after a STRUCTURAL change (atlas.yaml/drift_review/structural): every file older than the
                horizon that references a path this change touched, plus the hot/warm/cold tiers
  repos [root]  every sibling git repository: uncommitted, unpushed and behind counts, age of last commit
  worktrees     every worktree: branch, age of its last commit, uncommitted files, commits not on the
                default branch, and a verdict — active, finished (safe to remove), stale, locked or prunable

Ages are printed, never stored: a stored age is wrong the day after (rule: no calendar date in a
tracked file). WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE: that an old file is wrong — only that nobody has touched it; the
reader decides whether it is settled or forgotten.
