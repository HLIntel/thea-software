"""What the language bar will say, computed from the tree rather than predicted.

WHY (2.18.0). This repository has been wrong about its own language bar twice, in opposite
directions, and both times the error was a BLANKET rule over files that are not the same kind of
thing. At v2.0.0 Linguist reported 100% Python, because Markdown is prose and excluded by default
and the one directory holding code took the whole bar. The correction was `*.md
linguist-detectable=true` everywhere, which put 464 KB of guides and operating cards into the bar
and produced 61% Markdown — a routing table with a contract, described as a documentation
repository.

So the classification is per KIND now, and this computes the consequence. A projection nobody can
run is a guess, and a guess about what a reader sees first is exactly the kind of claim this
repository refuses to leave unmeasured.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE: what GitHub will actually publish. Linguist has heuristics this does not
implement — shebang detection, a size ceiling, vendor paths — so this is the REPOSITORY's reading
of its own `.gitattributes`, and the platform's reading is authoritative. `gh api
repos/OWNER/REPO/languages` is what settles it, and disagreement between the two is a finding.
