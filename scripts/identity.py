"""Who owns this tree, compared against the declaration — and the rename, as one operation.

WHY (2.23.0). Measured before this existed: the owner's name appeared 39 times across 13 files,
and most were LIVE — badge URLs, a CODEOWNERS handle, the `repository:` a reusable workflow checks
out, the target the platform audit points at, the banner's own filename. A rename by
find-and-replace flips all of them in one commit, and every one 404s until the account on the
other side exists. That is not a rename, it is an outage with a commit message.

THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is the opposite of the intuitive one:

  1. declare the successor here, `<half>_applied: false` — reviewable before it is live
  2. `identity.py --plan` — every file that would move, with its line, read by a person
  3. create the account and MOVE the repository on the platform
  4. only then `identity.py --apply`, flip `<half>_applied: true`, and re-run the whole ladder

Doing 4 before 3 breaks every badge, the reusable workflow's checkout and the platform audit at
once, and the failure arrives for readers rather than for the person who caused it.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO REWRITE. A licence names a copyright holder at a point in time; it is a legal
record and not a pointer, so `literal_allowed` holds it out and this tool never touches it.
