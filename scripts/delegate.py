"""The brief a delegated agent needs — `thea delegate [--task "..."]`. Under-specification is the failure.

WHY (3.23.0). Thea hands work to subagents, to opencode, to a free model for a second opinion. Measured
across 200 traces of 7 multi-agent frameworks (MAST, arXiv:2503.13657), the two largest failure buckets
are SPECIFICATION issues and INTER-AGENT MISALIGNMENT — together most of what goes wrong, and neither is
a model capability problem. They are briefs that did not say enough, and results taken on trust.

So a handoff here carries six things, and `delegation_contract` in atlas.yaml declares them once:
  goal        one sentence, the outcome — not the method, which is the delegate's to choose
  scope       the files or directories it may read and change; everything else is out
  acceptance  how ITS work is judged, in a command or an observable, never "do a good job"
  returns     the shape of the answer, so the caller can act on it without re-reading the work
  forbidden   what it must not do, including the actions that look helpful (widening scope, "fixing
              while here", editing what it was asked to review)
  read_only   THEA_READ_ONLY=1 for anything that is not explicitly the editing agent — an audit that
              can write is an audit that raced the editor (measured here at 3.9.0)

AND THE HALF EVERY FRAMEWORK GETS WRONG: what comes back is a HYPOTHESIS, not a result. It is confirmed
by an instrument in this repository or it is not confirmed. This file prints that line every time.
