"""The agent execution policy: six verdicts, decided from a declaration rather than from prose.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2.9.0). `atlas.yaml/task_profiles/autonomous_agent` named five controls from
2.0.0 — narrow_tools, sandbox, budget, approval, audit — and nothing in this tree enforced
one of them. An agent that never opened CLAUDE.md was subject to none of them, and from outside
a declared control and an enforced control print the same word. That is the same shape this
repository already refuses three times over: an invariant with no check, an instrument with no
closer, a roster with no count.

WHAT IT DECIDES AND WHAT IT CANNOT. Every function here is PURE: it takes a contract, a subject
and the declaration, and returns a verdict naming the control that refused. It therefore proves
exactly one thing — that a caller which ASKS is bounded. An agent that does not ask is bounded
by the host, which is why `agent_policy/sandbox_requirements` marks each row with who observes it
and why `agentrun.py` prints the host-observed ones as UNOBSERVED rather than as satisfied.

THE CONTRACT'S OWN BUDGETS ARE A PREFERENCE. A contract is written by the same agent these
controls bound, so `effective_budgets` takes the LOWER of the declaration and the contract —
never the contract alone.

    do this job: by the time a command is `argv` the pipeline, the quoting and the subshell are gone.

    WHAT IT PROVES. Three shapes, each measured, each SILENT when it fires:
      * `.`/`source` as a pipeline's first stage — the subshell takes every export with it, so the
        file appears to load and nothing it set survives.
      * `$?` after a pipeline ending in a text filter — the status read is the filter's.
      * a backtick inside a double-quoted `-m` value — the shell substitutes command output, usually
        empty, so the phrase is gone from the message and nothing warns.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. Not a shell parser and not a linter. It says nothing about a construct
    deliberately placed in `( )`, about `$?` after a non-filter pipeline (where the last stage's
    status is usually the one wanted), about two commands sharing a working directory, or about

    apparent latency — so nothing about the prompt, the token count or the tool roster predicts it.

    took 10.0s. Thirty times, same prompt and same model. Three diagnoses were tried and refuted first
    -- "the agent is broken" (it returned a normal end-of-turn), "the context is too large" (cutting
    10,518 tokens made it SLOWER, and the bare model served 31,134 tokens in 2.2s), and "too many tool
    servers" (disabling all of them halved the context and it was slower again).
