"""Property-based tests for the policy core: invariants over generated inputs, not planted examples.

WHY (2.28.0). agent_test plants the defects someone already imagined. A property states what must
hold for EVERY input — forbidden beats allowed, a lower budget never raises capacity, removing any
audit event breaks the chain — and a seeded generator hunts the boundary combinations no
hand-written fixture named. Stdlib `random` with a printed seed, so a failure replays exactly.

EACH PROPERTY IS MUTATION-TESTED BY CONSTRUCTION. It runs twice: against the real function, where
it must hold on every trial, and against a planted wrong implementation, where it must FAIL on at
least one. A property that also passes the mutant is too weak to catch the defect it names — the
harness is an instrument too. Counted into agent_test's CASES, so a skipped property moves its total.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. That the generator reaches every region: it draws from a declared alphabet
of path segments, budgets and fields. It widens what the planted suite covers; it does not replace it.
