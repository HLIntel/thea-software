"""Negative tests for the declared agent controls: each one must REFUSE its planted defect.

WHY NEGATIVE TESTS AND NOT A GREEN RUN. A control that never refuses anything and a control that
is broken print the same nothing. Every case below constructs the defect the control exists to
stop and asserts the refusal names the right control — and the reference contract is asserted to
pass FIRST, because a guard that fires on correct input gets silenced, and a silenced guard stops
nothing at all.

THE HELD-OUT CASE matters more than it looks: a contract the policy was never tuned against must
still validate and resolve. Without it these tests only prove the policy agrees with the one
contract it was written beside.
