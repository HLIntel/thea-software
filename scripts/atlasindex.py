"""A retrieval index that obeys the policy this repository declares, instead of describing one.

WHY (2.16.0). `atlas.yaml/retrieval_policy` named AST chunking, hybrid search, checksum
invalidation and a citation rule, and nothing here implemented any of it — a declaration with no
artifact, which is the exact shape `never_shipped_arm` refuses elsewhere in this tree. This builds
it, with the same standard-library-only constraint as the rest of the harness.

WHAT "DENSE" MEANS HERE, STATED PRECISELY BECAUSE THE WORD IS USUALLY BORROWED. This uses TF-IDF
cosine over token vectors. It is a real vector method and it is NOT a neural embedding: it matches
VOCABULARY OVERLAP, not meaning, so a true paraphrase sharing no terms with the query is missed.
That gap is named rather than papered over — a consumer who needs semantic recall brings a model
and swaps the scorer, and `retrieval_policy/search` still requires two methods because the sparse
arm finds exact symbols the cosine arm buries and vice versa.

EVERY RESULT CARRIES ITS PATH, ITS LINE RANGE AND THE CHECKSUM IT WAS READ AT. An answer whose
source cannot be opened is an answer that cannot be checked, and a chunk whose file has since
changed is reported STALE rather than returned as current.
